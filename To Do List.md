# To Do List
 - [x] Update the Styling to be more of what I like
- [x] Add the ability to edit achievements - First draft of this is done now. I want to play around more to make sure that it's good.
- [x] Update the styling to work better on Mobile Devices. - First cut of this is done now.
- [x] Improve the deployment. - I think I got this figured out.

**Notes on 2024-02-08**
I've worked a bit on the functionality of this project, enabling the edit process as well as updating the styling to work better on mobile devices. I suspect I've also largely got the issues on Vercel worked out so that it's playing. I will need to brainstorm more functionality that I want for this.

## Potential Enhancements
- Add the ability to upload images with the achievements
- Sort the achievements based on Date (asc/des), or priority
- Filter the achievements based on criteria (Start/End dates, priorities, or search text)
-- This might be a thing I need a separate form for. I'm not sure how it'd look on mobile.
